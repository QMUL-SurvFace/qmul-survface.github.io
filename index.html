            <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
            <p>To facilitate more studies for developing face recognition methods that are effective and robust against low-resolution surveillance facial images, 
               a new <em>Surveillance Face Recognition</em> challenge, <strong>QMUL-SurvFace</strong>, is introduced. 
               This new challenge is the largest and more importantly the only true surveillance face recognition benchmark to our best knowledge, 
               where low-resolution face images are native and not synthesised by artificial down-sampling of native high-resolution images. 
               This challenge contains <strong>463,507</strong> face images of <strong>15,573</strong> distinct identities captured in real-world 
               uncooperative surveillance scenes across wide space and time. 
               Face recognition is generally more difficult in an
               open-set setting which is typical for surveillance person search scenarios,
               owing to an arbitrarily large number of non-target people
               (distractors) appearing over open space and unconstrained time.
