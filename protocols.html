      <meta name="description" content="To facilitate more studies on developing face recognition models that are effective and robust 
         for low-resolution surveillance facial images, we introduce a new Surveillance Face Recognition Challenge, 
         which we call the QMUL-SurvFace benchmark. 
         This new benchmark is the largest and more importantly the only true surveillance face recognition benchmark 
         to our best knowledge, where low-resolution images are not synthesised by artificial down-sampling 
         of native high-resolution images. This challenge contains 463,507 face images of 15,573 distinct identities 
         captured in real-world uncooperative surveillance scenes over wide space and time. 
         Face recognition is generally more difficult in an open-set setting which is typical for surveillance scenarios, 
         owing to a large number of non-target people (distractors) appearing open spaced scenes.">

               The same data partition is used for both (I) Face Identification and (II) Face Verification
               challenges. Specifically,
               the 10,638 multi-shot identities (IDs) with 2 or more face images were divided randomly into
               two halves: one half (5,319) as the training data, the
               other half (5,319) as the test data. The remaining 4,935 single-shot
               IDs (totally 10,254) were used for model test. 
               The data partition statistics
               are summarsied in the Table below.

            <h3 id="identification">(I) Face Identification</h3>
            <p>In this challenge, an <strong>open-set</strong> face recognition protocol is adopted based on the consideration that
               in realistic surveillance applications, most faces captured by CCTV cameras 
               are of non-target persons and therefore should be detected as non-interest.
               Specifically, a watch
               list identification scenario is defined by creating
               the probe and gallery sets as below: (1) 3,000 out of the 5,319
               multi-shot test IDs were randomly selected. For each selected ID,
               half face images went into
               the gallery set, i.e. the watch list. (2) All the remaining
               images of 5,319 multi-shot IDs and all face images of 4,935 single-shot IDs were then used to
               form the probe set.
               In the open-set evaluation,
               two error types are considered.
            </p>
            <p>
               The first type is <em>false alarm</em> – the system mistakenly
               recognises a non-target person as some target people in the gallery.
               This is quantified by the False Positive Identification
               Rate (FPIR):
            </p>
            <p><img style="width: 130px;" src="./images/fpir.png"></p>
            <p>which measures the proportion of nonmate searches <img style="width: 30px;" src="./images/Nnmm.png"/>
               (i.e. no mate faces in the gallery) that produce
               one or more gallery matching candidates at or above a threshold
               t (i.e. false alarm), among a total of <img style="width: 30px;" src="./images/Nnm.png"/> nonmate
               searches attempted.
            </p>
            <p>The second type of error is <em>missing</em>
               – the system mistakenly
               declines the ID of interest.
               This is quantified
               by the False Negative Identification Rate (FNIR):
            </p>
            <p><img style="width: 150px;" src="./images/fnir.png"></p>
            <p>which is the proportion of mate searches <img style="width: 25px;" src="./images/Nmnm.png"/> 
               (i.e. with mate faces present in the gallery) with enrolled gallery mate(s)
               found outside top r ranks or matching similarity score
               below the threshold t, among <img style="width: 20px;" src="./images/Nm.png"/> 
               mate searches.
            </p>
            <p>
               A more intuitive measure may be the
               <em>hit rate</em> or True Positive Identification Rate (TPIR):
            </p>
            <p><img style="width: 200px;" src="./images/tpir.png"></p>
            <p>The TPIR@FPIR measurements are adopted as the open-set face identification performance metrics. 
            </p>
            <p>By varying the threashold t, TPIR@FPIR can be used to generate an ROC curve and the Area Under the Curve (AUC)
               can be then computed to measure an overall model performance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
            <h3 id="verification">(II) Face Verification</h3>
            <p>This challenge verifies whether a pair of face images describe the same ID or not.
               Similar to other existing benchmarks like LFW, the sets of <em>matched</em> 
               and <em>unmatched</em> pairs were defined for algorithm performance evaluation.
               Specifically, for each of 5,319 test IDs, a matched pair and an unmatched pair
               were randomly generated. To measure the performance of testing algorithms on these 
               matched and unmatched face image pairs, 
               two types of error are considered.
            </p>
            <p>
               The first one is <em>false accept</em> – the system wrongly claims a distractor as a target gallery ID.
               This is quatified by the False Accept Rate (FAR) which measures the fraction of unmatched pairs with the corresponding score s above a threshold t:
            </p>
            <p><img style="width: 250px;" src="./images/far.png"/></p>
            <p>
               where <img style="width: 15px;" src="./images/u.png"/> denotes the set of unmatched face image pairs. 
            </p>
            <p> 
               The second one is <em>false reject</em> – the system mistakenly
               declines the person of interest. This is quantified by 
               the False Rejection Rate (FRR) which measures the
               fraction of matched pairs with matching score s below a threshold t:
            </p>
            <p><img style="width: 250px;" src="./images/frr.png"/></p>
            <p>where <img style="width: 17px;" src="./images/m.png"/> is the set of matched face image pairs.</p>
            <p>   
               In the same spirit of TPIR,
               the True Accept Rate (TAR) can be further defined:
            </p>
            <p><img style="width: 160px;" src="./images/tar.png"/></p>
            <p>
               The TAR@FAR measurements are utilised for face verification evaluation.
               By varying the threashold t, TAR@FAR can similarly generate an ROC curve and enable to compute the AUC
               overall model performance.
