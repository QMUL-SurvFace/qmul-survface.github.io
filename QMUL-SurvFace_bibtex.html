      <meta name="description" content="To facilitate more studies on developing face recognition models that are effective and robust 
         for low-resolution surveillance facial images, we introduce a new Surveillance Face Recognition Challenge, 
         which we call the QMUL-SurvFace benchmark. 
         This new benchmark is the largest and more importantly the only true surveillance face recognition benchmark 
         to our best knowledge, where low-resolution images are not synthesised by artificial down-sampling 
         of native high-resolution images. This challenge contains 463,507 face images of 15,573 distinct identities 
         captured in real-world uncooperative surveillance scenes over wide space and time. 
         Face recognition is generally more difficult in an open-set setting which is typical for surveillance scenarios, 
         owing to a large number of non-target people (distractors) appearing open spaced scenes.">
