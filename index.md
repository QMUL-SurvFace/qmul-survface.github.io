### Description
To facilitate more studies on developing FR models that are effective and robust for low-resolution surveillance facial images, we introduce a new Surveillance Face Recognition Challenge, which we call the QMUL-SurvFace benchmark. This new benchmark is the largest and more importantly the only true surveillance FR benchmark to our best knowledge, where low-resolution images are not synthesised by artificial down-sampling of native high-resolution images. This challenge contains 463,507 face images of 15,573 distinct identities captured in real-world uncooperative surveillance scenes over wide space and time. 
Face recognition is generally more difficult in an
open-set setting which is typical for surveillance scenarios,
owing to a large number of non-target people
(distractors) appearing open spaced scenes.
